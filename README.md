# Sukhreet Rai . Jarvis Consulting

I am a graduate of Computer software engineering from Sheridan College. I developed apps using popular programming languages such as Java, .Net, C++ and C#. I tutored juniors to help them learn mobile app development. I am a dedicated and motivated individual, and i am working as a software developer at Jarvis. I am contributing to industry projects on various platforms with the help of different programming languages such as Linux, Java, and Python. I am a self-starter, team player and multitasker who strives to consistently exceed expectations.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This project will take snapshots of the cluster's hardware specifications and resource usage (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time by using Bash Scripts, PostgreSQL, and Crontab. The application will utilize grep to retrieve the different usage values and post them to a PostgreSQL database. The automation is done using Crontab to run a Bash script to post the information to PostgreSQL. This will allow user to monitor the usage on each cluster to detect any performance failures.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai/tree/master/core_java)]: 
 - Twitter App: Implemented a Twitter CRD app that used a Java DAO to interact with Twitter's REST API to post, show, or delete tweets. The app was tested with JUnit and Mockito, various integration tests and unit tests were done to ensure that project is working correctly. In addition, spring framework is also applied to handle dependency management and injection concerns. The app was deployed through Dockerhub as a Docker image for easy distribution and execution.
  - JDBC App: Implemented a JDBC app that connects to a postgreSQL database. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed to update the database, the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern was used for easy application layer and database management.
  - Grep App: Created a grep app in Java that allows user to search for files within a root directory and its subdirectories, returning all lines containing a user-supplied matching regex pattern. The app is very similar to the grep command in Linux, and also uses stream APIs and lambda notation to handle insufficient memory problems. The app was dockerized and deployed on Dockerhub for easy access and distribution.

## Highlighted Projects
**Community Improvement**: This proof-of-concept app was designed as a way to let users quickly and easily flag broken or damaged infrastructure in their community to 311 in Toronto. It made use of geolocation data to simplify the process of communicating where maintenance crews needed to go to fix each issue. This application was built using React Native and Next.js, which was used to access hardware GPS information to provide accurate geolocation data.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Implemented a series of back-end Java and Linux-based projects using industry-standard tools such as Docker, Maven, Springboot, and Junit. Learned and applied multiple computer science concepts in a software development lifecycle context. Collaborated in a team setting using the agile scrum framework to conduct daily meetings and project retrospectives.
