# Sukhreet Rai . Jarvis Consulting

I am a graduate student from Sheridan College specializing in Computer system technician software engineering. During my course of studies, I developed apps using many popular programming languages with the help of a recent tech stack. I was able to tutor computer system junior students to help them with projects. I am a dedicated and motivated individual who is currently working with Jarvis to gain and contribute to some industry-level projects on various platforms with the help of different programming languages such as Linux, Java, and Python in an agile work environment. I am a self-starter, team player and multitasker who strives to consistently exceed expectations. I am an analytical thinker and problem solver.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SukhreetRai/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and usage of various nodes and store the collected data into database. The monitoring agent was developed through the use of bash scripts and utilizeed a PostgreSQL databse, provisioned by docker. Bash Scripts were programmed to extract hardware specifications. Crontab was designed to get the periodic updates of the usage data. Testing was done by running sample bash scripts to make sure the output is same as expected.

## Highlighted Projects
**Community Improvement**: This proof-of-concept app was designed as a way to let users quickly and easily flag broken or damaged infrastructure in their community to 311 in Toronto. It made use of geolocation data to simplify the process of communicating where maintenance crews needed to go to fix each issue. This application was built using React Native and Next.js, which was used to access hardware GPS information to provide accurate geolocation data.
