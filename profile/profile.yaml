# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a graduate student from Sheridan College specializing in Computer system technician software engineering. During my course of studies, I developed apps using many popular programming languages with the help of a recent tech stack. I was able to tutor computer system junior students to help them with projects. I am a dedicated and motivated individual who is currently working with Jarvis to gain and contribute to some industry-level projects on various platforms with the help of different programming languages such as Linux, Java, and Python in an agile work environment. I am a self-starter, team player and multitasker who strives to consistently exceed expectations. I am an analytical thinker and problem solver.

    description: Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and usage of various nodes and store the collected data into database. The monitoring agent was developed through the use of bash scripts and utilizeed a PostgreSQL databse, provisioned by docker. Bash Scripts were programmed to extract hardware specifications. Crontab was designed to get the periodic updates of the usage data. Testing was done by running sample bash scripts to make sure the output is same as expected.
